The following information has been altered accordingly:

- An attempt to add the original contributors uuids for future proofing the Spider Queen mod (can be wrong).
- A render rework to apply the current texture and name of the original contributors.
- A config file to alter the delay of offerings to creepers, skeletons, and zombies in seconds (range of 1 to 20, default is 1).
- An editable config file through the mod list gui.
- Added a config variable to add myself to the list of names if you decide to (default is false).
- Placing the lang file back in the lang folder after an unknown mixup.
