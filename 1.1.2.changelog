The following information has been altered accordingly:

- The skull, heart, and brains now have a cool down feature of one second before another can be picked from a stack of dropped items.
- The entities reputation will no longer crash the game due to the like data not being found

Removed the 1.1 version of the mod due to an oversight of how coremods work.
